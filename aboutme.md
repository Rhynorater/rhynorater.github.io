title: About me
---

My name is Justin Gardner (also known as Rhynorater). I'm a penetration tester for [SynerComm](https://synercomm.com) and a bug bounty hunter on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/rhynorater), [Bugcrowd](https://hackerone.com/rhynorater), SynAck, and several other bug bounty platforms. My interests are continuous reconnaissance, programming security tools, and discovering new exploitation techniques. 

I really enjoy mentoring and teaching. If would like assistance getting into the bug bounty or hacking scene, please contact me. I will gladly share with you what little knowledge I have if you prove to me that you are willing to work for it and are not just looking to be spoon fed success.
