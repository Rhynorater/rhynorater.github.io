title: About me
---

My name is Justin Gardner (also known as Rhynorater). I am currently a full-time bug bounty hunter living in Yokohama, Japan. I previously worked for [SynerComm](https://synercomm.com) as a Penetration Tester and [Veivos](https://www.veivos.com) as an IT Architect. My security interests are web applications, continuous reconnaissance, and 0-day hunting. Outside of security, my hobbies are language learning (I speak Italian and Japanese), Volleyball, Jiu-Jitsu, and spending time with my lovely wife Mariah. 

I am also a Christian and love to talk about Jesus! If you are someone who wants to talk about Jesus or a Christian yourself, please reach out! 

I really enjoy mentoring and teaching. If would like assistance getting into the bug bounty or hacking scene, please contact me. I will gladly share with you what little knowledge I have if you prove to me that you are willing to work for it and are not just looking to be spoon fed success.
