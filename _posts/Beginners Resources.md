One of the questions I get all the time is `How do I get started in bug bounty?` While I really enjoy teaching and mentoring, I often get frustrated with the people I am trying to help because they are looking for me to hold their hand and lead them to bug bounty success. **I will gladly point you in the right direction, answer questions that you've ready researched (but have been unable to find a solution for), and help you to exploit and escalate vulnerabilities.** Because I care about your carrerial success, I will try to teach you how to teach yourself. 

I will let you know ahead of time, bug bounty requires a large amount of:
- determination in the face of disappointment and self-doubt
- self-motivation
- the ability to continuously absorb a lot of new research
